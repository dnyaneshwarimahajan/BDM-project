🍴 Business Data Management Capstone – Bhole Bharit and Nashta Center
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains my IIT Madras Business Data Management (BDM) Capstone Project, where I applied data-driven methods to analyze and optimize a local restaurant’s sales, purchases, and inventory. The objective was to increase sales, improve profitability, and design sustainable customer acquisition strategies.

🎯 Problem Statement

Bhole Bharit and Nashta Center, a small restaurant in Jalgaon, faced challenges such as:

Lack of digital records for sales and purchases.

Inefficient inventory management leading to high costs and wastage.

Low customer retention due to limited marketing and service delays.

Misleading restaurant branding and poor menu optimization.

The goal of this project was to digitize their data, analyze sales patterns, and recommend strategies for profitability and growth.

🛠️ Approach

Data Collection & Cleaning

Collected primary data from owner’s handwritten records and observations.

Created structured datasets in Excel and Python (pandas).

Analysis Techniques

Descriptive Statistics → sales trends, profit margins, daily/weekly averages.

Correlation & Regression → dependencies between sales, costs, and raw materials.

Clustering & Menu Engineering → identified high-profit vs. low-profit dishes.

Pivot Tables & Charts → sales visualization by order method (Dine-In, Parcel, Zomato).

Tools Used

Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Excel: Pivot tables, Pivot charts, SUMIF, VLOOKUP

📊 Key Findings

Average Daily Sales: ₹3,212 with 16.6% monthly profit margin.

Order Methods: Parcel (49%) was most profitable; Dine-In had higher per-order value.

Best Sellers: Shev Bhaji, Dal Tadka, Jira Rice (high sales & high profit).

Cost Drivers: Grocery (especially oil, onions, and paneer) caused major expense volatility.

Customer Behavior: 83% of revenue came from frequent small orders, mostly via parcels.

💡 Recommendations

Rebrand & Market: Rename restaurant for clarity; adopt digital/social media marketing.

Optimize Menu: Promote high-profit items; remove/adjust low-performing dishes.

Improve Dine-In Experience: Enhance ambience and run offers to increase high-value dine-in sales.

Inventory Strategy: Buy onions, oil, and spices in bulk; invest in storage to reduce waste.

Customer Retention: Introduce loyalty programs for parcel customers.

🚀 Outcomes

Built a data-driven business model to help the restaurant optimize operations.

Delivered insights that could increase profitability, improve efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.
